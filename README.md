📊 Financial-Models
Welcome to my Financial Models repository!

As a finance professional with hands-on experience as a Financial Analyst, I’ve developed and worked on financial models for over 15 companies during my career. While those projects were internal and proprietary, this space allows me to continue that passion — by building, exploring, and sharing case-study-based financial models across various industries and business types.

🔍 What You’ll Find Here:
📁 Industry-Specific Models (e.g., SaaS, Retail, Manufacturing, etc.)

📈 Three-Statement Models (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)

💰 Valuation Models (DCF, Comparable Companies, LBOs)

🔧 Scenario & Sensitivity Analyses

🧠 Advanced Excel techniques for automation and insights

🧾 Why This Repo?
I love working with numbers, business assumptions, and strategy — and translating that into models that drive real decisions. This repository is a growing portfolio to demonstrate my ability to build everything from basic templates to advanced, investor-ready models.

Whether you’re a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow enthusiast — I hope this gives you a glimpse into the depth of my modeling skills and my genuine interest in business analysis.

🛠️ Tools Used
Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Advanced Formulas, Charts)

Occasional Power BI for dashboard views

GitHub for version tracking and organization

📌 More Coming Soon
I’ll continue to update this repo with new case studies, industry-specific templates, and refined models. Stay tuned!
